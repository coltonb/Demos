# Demos
A collection of various demos I've made. Didn't think they needed their own repository so they shall reside here.

# The list
1. [**Points:**](https://coltonb.github.io/Demos/points/points.html) Edges and vertices.
2. [**Bubbles:**](https://coltonb.github.io/Demos/bubbles/bubbles.html) Popping bubbles.
3. [**Snek:**](https://coltonb.github.io/Demos/snek/snek.html) An unintuitive snake game. WASD to move. **Caution to those with epilypsy.**
4. [**Editor:**](https://colttonb.github.io/Demos/editor/editor.html) A pixel editor that will maybe eventually become something besides just a pixel editor.
